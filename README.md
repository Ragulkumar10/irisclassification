# Iris Dataset Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The goal is to build and deploy a robust classification model that accurately predicts the species of iris flowers using various machine learning algorithms.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages: `pip install numpy`, `pip install matplotlib`, `pip install seaborn`, `pip install pandas`

### Data

The Iris dataset (`iris.csv`) is available in the directory. The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding iris species.


## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Future Improvements

- Explore advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or deep learning for enhanced model performance.
- Consider integrating explainability techniques to better understand the model's decision-making process.
